This guidance will take you through the process of publishing data that meets the technical specifications required by the Planning Data platform.

This is the process for publishing data as a CSV file. 

Alternatively, you can publish your data using a web-based interface, such as OGC Web Feature Services. 

This will require more technical ability in your organisation, but will enable you to update data automatically. 

Please message <digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk> if you are interested in setting up this process.

How to publish your data
------------------------

Publishing is a 5 step process:

1.  [Enter your data in a CSV file](#{{ 'Step 1: Enter your data in a CSV file' | slugify }})

2.  [Provide your documentation](#{{ 'Step 2: Provide your documentation' | slugify }})

3.  [Create or update the webpage hosting your data](#{{ 'Step 3: Create or update the webpage hosting your data' | slugify }})

4.  [Tell Planning Data where the webpage is](#{{ 'Step 4: Tell Planning Data where the webpage is' | slugify }})

5.  [Check that the data has met the specification](#{{ 'Step 5: Check that the data has met the specification' | slugify }})

Step 1: Enter your data in a CSV file
-------------------------------------

Create a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers or another program. 

You may need to create more than one CSV for each data subject. Guidance on what to include is in the [data specifications guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1238jN1pfz80I2WKVArPi8mhzwOfVrLr5CmYKS0N1uLk/edit#).

The data needed for the RIPA service is:

-   [Conservation area data](specifications/conservation-area.html)
-   [Listed building data](specifications/listed-building.html)
-   [Article 4 direction data](specifications/article-4-direction.html)
-   [Tree preservation order data](specifications/tree-preservation-order.html)

{{ govukInsetText({ 'text': 'Save as the file type "CSV"' }) }}

Step 2: Provide your documentation
----------------------------------

For most data subjects, you must also publish links to supporting documentation that gives evidence that the data is correct.

See the [data specifications guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1238jN1pfz80I2WKVArPi8mhzwOfVrLr5CmYKS0N1uLk/edit#) for how to provide this for each different subject.

Step 3: Create or update the webpage hosting your data
------------------------------------------------------

To complete step 3, you must be able to edit a webpage on your LPA's official website. This will probably have a URL ending in .gov.uk or .org.

If you aren't able or authorised to do this, please speak to a person who updates your organisation's website.

### Create a webpage

Create a separate webpage for each dataset. This webpage must have a URL that does not change, so the Planning Data platform can keep collecting the data.

If the URL does change, please email <digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk>.

You may want to use an alias to create a short URL that is easy to remember. For example: https://www.yourLPA.gov.uk/conservation-area-data

### Describe the data

Add a short description of the data on the page. We recommend including these descriptors as a minimum:

### Summary

Briefly explain what the data is about. For example:

This dataset shows the locations of conservation areas. Conservation areas are designated to safeguard areas of special architectural and historic interest, the character and appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance. Within these areas special planning controls operate which need to be considered when undertaking development.

### Licensing

State that the data is provided under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

### Last updated

State the date you are creating or updating the webpage.

Upload the CSV files
--------------------

Upload the CSV files of data and documentation to your LPA's website. 

Publish them on the webpage you created.

---

Step 4: Tell Planning Data where the webpage is
-----------------------------------------------

If you are creating a new webpage, you must tell us the URL. Email the URL of the webpage containing your files to <digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk>.

If you have already told us, you can skip this step. The Planning Data platform will regularly collect data from the URL you have given us.

If the URL ever changes, please tell us.

---

Step 5: Check that the data has met the specification
-----------------------------------------------------

Our feedback tool will check if your data has met the specification.

If there are any fields flagged as "Not met" or "Has recommendations", review these and reupload your files.
