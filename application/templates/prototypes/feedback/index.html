        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">User needs</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
          <li>As a GIS officer, I need to understand what DL means by a unique reference and why it’s important, so that I can find a suitable solution that works for me and my policy colleagues.</li>
          <li>As a GIS/policy officer, I need to know the deadline for resolving an issue, to that I know how quickly I need to act.</li>
          <li>As a GIS officer, I need to see the sources DL has, so that I can check them.</li>
          <li>As a GIS/policy officer, I need to be notified of actions, so that I know when there are changes that need my attention.</li>
          <li>As a GIS/policy officer, I need to resolve actions so that I don’t have to repetitively check (something that isn’t wrong).</li>
          <li>As a planning policy officer, I need something unique to identify an error, so that I can find (the entity) within my own datasets.</li>
          <li>As a GIS/policy officer, I need to visualise my data on a map, so that I can see the data and errors more quickly.</li>
          <li>As a GIS/policy officer, I need to see which points on the map have errors or missing attributes, so that I can investigate them.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Things the prototype should include</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
          <li>Actions and recommendations per dataset</li>
          <li>Map and text view or errors </li>
          <li>Unique reference for entity that the user can use to search their own data</li>
          <li>Dynamic errors/actions</li>
          <li>Dynamic naming rather than entity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Iterations from v1 to v2</h2>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
          <li>Remove summary section from all pages</li>
          <li>Include timeframe for action to be taken</li>
          <li>Separate actions that are needed vs recommendations within the data collection report </li>
          <li>Compile / include a list of errors and make them more relevant to the ways users are providing data and the kinds of datasets</li>
          <li>offer a way to ignore/remove something that isn't actually an error/problem (maybe an email to JIRA for now?)</li>
          <li>Use whatever the 'unique ID' for an entity is, rather than address</li>
          <li>Change map red dots to be all entities that need action rather than only entities outside of the LPA boundary</li>
          <li>Potentially? combine the map view and text view of the data subset page</li>
          <li>Get rid of the word entity and replace with dynamic word for each dataset, eg. TPOs, conservations areas, listed buildings</li>
        </ul>
